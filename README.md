# :books: Academic Calendar App :books:
College students across the world rely on calendar/scheduler applications to track their due dates, upcoming exams, etc. However, these tools are not optimized specifically for use by college students.

Our team sought out to create a solution that better accomodates student life with separate schedulers to track recurring class meeting times, exam dates, and assignment deadlines.

## :calendar: Schedule Page :calendar:
The schedule page allows students to create courses, exams, and assignments as calendar items and view each on its own scroll-view.

- Courses are recurring events that display relevant details such as professor name, meeting location, meeting days, etc.
- Exams are independently scheduled events (do not repeat by default) that display relevant details such as exam location, date, time, etc.
- Assignments are independently scheduled events (do not repeat by default) that display relevant details such as due date, associated course, etc.

Once an event is created, it can easily be edited or deleted as necesary.

If applicable to the event type, it can also be marked as complete. More details on this functionality can be found under the [to-do list page section](#clipboard-to-do-list-page-clipboard).

## :clipboard: To-do List Page :clipboard:
The to-do list stores any events that can be completed. For instance, an assignment can be completed, while a course cannot be.

Custom event types can also be made on this page. This is perfect for scenarios when the student has tasks they'd like to keep track of that are not necessarily coursework (i.e., pay for rent).

To-do list items are filterable by completeness, for when you only want to see what still needs to be completed. They are also sortable by name and date.
